Augmented reality systems (AR) are defined as systems that enable real time interactions with virtual and real objects that coexist in the same space \cite{Azuma1997}. These systems come in many different forms such as head-worn displays, projections, and mobile devices that allow you to view virtual objects in the real world. For decades, researchers have observed the great potential of using augmented reality to enhance certain aspects in fields such as geographic studies \cite{Wang2018}, data science \cite{Zhang2018}, education, and health. Unlike virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) allows for an digital experience in a real environment rather than a fully virtual environment. In some cases, interactions within an AR environment are more advantageous than the VR environment \cite{Krichenbauer2017}. Bower et al. \cite{Bower2014} highlight the usage of mobile phones and tablets to overlay media onto the real world in order to make information available to students when they need it, on the spot. Bower et al. discuss the potential reduction of cognitive overload by providing students real time information. Augmented reality has also found a home within the health field, specifically the medical field, where it is used in various medical tasks and procedures.

This work will primarily be focused on head-worn see-through display such as the Microsoft Hololens \cite{Hololens}, a new headset that enables users to interact with virtual objects in the real world. Due to the novelty of this display and the ongoing development of the software required to create applications for this display, there are not many studies involving the Hololens as of yet. Design choices outlined in Kress et al.'s work \cite{Kress2017} show the carefully thought out architecture of the Hololens. The balance of comfort and performance for the first fully untethered mixed reality headset makes this ARHWD one of the most advanced and the currently the best candidate to use within the augmented reality reasearch space. 

Designing interactions in AR has been a topic of discussion for as long as the concept of AR existed. In 1993, Feiner et al. \cite{Feiner1993} looked into implementing 2D windows in a 3D augmented reality. This was one of the earliest works in augmented reality, and they were able to create a system that overlaid images on a see through display, simulating virtual windows containing information in a real-world environment.

A survey done by Azuma et al. \cite{Azuma1997} explained the advancements in 1997, the applications of AR, and some issues such as real-time tracking and portability. This survey was to provide a beginning point for researchers interested in this area. Many issues outlined by Azuma et al. in their survey have been address in recent years. The hardware is only one part of the design required to create a smooth augmented experience. Future research focuses more on the interface and interactions with the virtual objects in the real world environment.

Early works, such as the work done by Bell et al. \cite{Bell2001} describe maintaining visual constraints on the virtual objects projected on the view plane. Simply put, they attempted to design an algorithm to aid in managing constraints such as locating related virtual objects or preventing the objects from occluding each other. Their algorithm yielded comfortable interactions, however, Bell et al. believed it could have been significantly improved. 

In subsequent years, a plethora of research on AR becomes a cycle and blend of outlining potentials, addressing issues at the time, and a survey of the state of AR. Works such as the ones done by Zhong et al. \cite{Zhong2003} and Boulanger et al. \cite{Boulanger2004} outline the potential in using AR in industrial training. Bower et al. \cite{Bower2014} look into the applications in education and its potential to improve learning in schools. In the health industry, researchers such as Barsom et al. \cite{Barsom2016}, Chan et al. \cite{Chan2017}, Chen et al. \cite{Chen2015}, and Okamoto et al. \cite{Okamoto2015} look at AR's potential in surgery and medical training. However, many of the works outlining potentials do not develop as well as evaluate the application leading to inconclusive results.

Barsom et al. \cite{Barsom2016} details the effectiveness of augmented reality applications in medical training. These applications are used to blend virtual and digital elements with a physical environment in order to introduce new educational opportunities for medical professionals. Barsom et al. reviewed seven applications over twenty-six studies and concluded that although these promising applications are generating public as well as scientific interest, they are lacking evidence in the literature that the applications are able to transfer information to the user.

In recent years, researchers have investigated the use of AR in order to improve surgical navigation. Both Okamoto et al. \cite{Okamoto2015} and Chen et al. \cite{Chen2015} developed AR-based simulations with the aim to improve the safety and reliability of surgery. Okamoto et al. developed an application for navigation surgery in the abdominal field. Their system leverage a see through display and a rigid scope that enables the surgeons to obtain a 3D view. Through their study, they are able to identify several problems such as organ deformity, evaluation of utility, portability and cost. In the same year, Chen et al. leveraged a head-worn display and created an application that was tested against actual patient structure data in a real world scenario. They verified and demonstrated the accuracy of their application was sufficient to meet clinical requirements. However, this is so far only true with a simulated environment. Within the same area of study, Pratt et al. \cite{Pratt2018} looked the use of the Hololens in order to provide a means of bringing a new level of precision and planning into reconstructive surgery. Through preliminary studies, the authors were able to demonstrate that using the ARHWD could help with the precise localisation of perforating vessels. Hanna et al. \cite{Hanna2018} have also showed that the Hololens has the sufficient power and comfort to be useful in facilitating autopsies, microscopic examinations, and digital pathology. There are 

In the past, there have seen very few works involving the use of augmented reality head-worn displays (ARHWDs), the popularity of the concept due to it's portability has been steadily increasing, however, there is still room for improvement in order to give the user a more comfortable experience \cite{Velamkayala2017}, which may in turn provide a more efficient experience. Although, work such as The Personal Cockpit \cite{Ens2014}, an evaluated design space for effective task switching on ARHWDs and Ethereal Planes \cite{Ens2014a}, an extensively reviewed design framework provide guidelines to assist in the creation of meaningful layouts and interfaces to experiment with. As far as I know, there has not been any work done on determining the efficiency of using AR head-worn displays such as the Hololens to act as an aid in completing procedural or analytical tasks.
