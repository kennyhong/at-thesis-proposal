\section{Expected Outcomes}
\label{sec:expectedoutcomes}

In terms of contribution, the expected results of this research are related to the advancements in supporting disciplines with complex procedural tasks. When conducting a task that require stepwise instructions, I hope to improve the experience of completing these tasks by using augmented reality head worn displays (ARHWDs). I expect to develop a set of guidelines for the implementation of information-displaying applications on ARHWDs. As a result, I also expect to develop an algorithm to optimize the placement of information on ARHWDs. The algorithm would improve the user experience by adapting to the environment in way where the user can efficiently complete a task.
