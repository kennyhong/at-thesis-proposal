\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
	This research aims to create a set of guidelines that aid in the implementation of efficient information spaces for performing procedural and analytical tasks with an augmented reality head-worn devices (ARHWD). With the emergence of new immersive ARHWDs such as the Microsoft Hololens, this research looks into the possibility of leveraging these technologies to support us in performing procedural tasks in a variety of disciplines such as medical training and simulations. This research evaluates different layouts and spaces based on previous research as well as expert preferences in order to compare the most optimal ways to design a supportive ARHWD application. Through the user studies, I hope to create a novel framework based on the results and comparisons that will help others create a effective information spaces to efficiently complete tasks that require additional information.
