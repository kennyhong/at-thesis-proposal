\begin{abstract}
The vast health industry is always looking for innovative ways to use technology to create or improve the experiences of a variety of areas from analysing relevant health data to improving the delivery of medical education and training. With advancements in head-worn immersive mixed reality displays (HWD) such as the Microsoft Hololens, we must look into the feasibility of leverage the technology to aid us in the ongoing challenge of creating these meaningful and educational experiences. In this research, I will be evaluating the efficiency of using an immersive HWD in order to perform procedural and analytical tasks. The objective of this research is to develop a set of guidelines that assists in the creation of 2D information spaces that would enable opportunities to create mixed reality applications that would improve the educational and training aspects of the health field. I hope to create a framework that would inspire discussion as well as the creation and evaluation of different information space designs on HWDs.
