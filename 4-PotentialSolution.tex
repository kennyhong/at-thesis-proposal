\begin{itemize}
	\item I will be exploring the current technology being used for training and simulation in the health field. Getting familiar with tools and devices being used is important, with no prior knowledge of medical procedures or analytical procedures to observe data, taking measures to understand the current state, as well as interviewing primary users such as medical professionals and scientists is crucial to developing effective guidelines for creating virtual information spaces for ARHWDs.
	\item There are many different procedures to draw inspiration from to create experiments that measure important variables such as accuracy, error rate, and time efficiency. It is important to create experiments where important aspects of many procedures can be tested such as completing tasks using information given by the ARHWD while evaluating the variables above. 
	\item By drawing results from the studies, I hope to develop a set of guidelines for researchers and developers of ARHWD applications to consider in order to create effective and efficient interfaces and interaction for users.
